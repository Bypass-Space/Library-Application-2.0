The code begins by importing the sqlite3 module, which provides the necessary functionality to interact with SQLite databases.

The LibrarySystem class is defined, which encapsulates the functionality of the library management system.

In the constructor (__init__ method) of the LibrarySystem class:

The sqlite3.connect() function is called to establish a connection to the SQLite database file named 'library.db'. The connection object is assigned to the self.conn attribute.
A cursor object is created using self.conn.cursor() and assigned to the self.cursor attribute. The cursor is used to execute SQL statements and fetch results from the database.
The create_tables method is defined within the LibrarySystem class to create the necessary tables in the database if they don't already exist. It performs the following actions:

The execute method of the cursor object is used to execute the SQL statement that creates the 'books' table. The table has columns for book ID, book name, author, publication date, and number of copies. The IF NOT EXISTS clause ensures that the table is only created if it doesn't already exist.
To check if the 'members' table exists, a select statement is executed using the execute method of the cursor. It selects the count of tables with the name 'members' from the 'sqlite_master' table. The result is fetched using the fetchone method, and the count value is stored in the table_exists variable.
If the 'members' table doesn't exist (table_exists is 0), the execute method is used to create the 'members' table. It has columns for member ID, member name, and email. After creating the table, the changes are committed to the database using self.conn.commit().
The 'records' table is created similarly to the 'books' table. It has columns for record ID, member ID, book ID, borrowed date, and returned date. Foreign key constraints are defined to link the member ID and book ID columns to their respective tables. Again, the changes are committed to the database using self.conn.commit().
The start method is defined within the LibrarySystem class. It prompts the user to enter a username and password. If the provided username is 'GUEST' and the password is 'root', the method returns the entered username and password. Otherwise, it displays an error message and recursively calls itself to prompt for credentials again.

The run_library_system method is the main entry point of the library management system. It performs the following actions:

Calls the create_tables method to ensure the required tables exist in the database.
Calls the start method to prompt for user credentials and retrieves the username and password.
Displays a menu of options to the user using the menu string.
Enters a while loop that continues until the user chooses to quit.
Within the loop, it prompts the user for a choice using input() and stores it in the choice variable.
Based on the user's choice, different actions are performed:
If the choice is '1', it prompts the user for the book ID and member ID to check out a book. It then checks if the book and member exist and if copies are available. If all conditions are met, it inserts a record into the 'records' table to indicate the book has been borrowed and updates the 'copies' count in the 'books' table.
If the choice is '2', it prompts the user for the book ID to return a book. It checks if the book exists and if it is borrowed. If so, it updates the 'returned date' in the 'records' table to indicate the book has been returned and updates the 'copies' count in the 'books' table.
If the choice is '3', it prompts the user for member details (name and email) to add a new member. It then inserts the member into the 'members' table.
If the choice is '4', it prompts the user for book details (name, author, publication date, and number of copies) to add a new book. It inserts the book into the 'books' table.
If the choice is '5', it selects all rows from the 'books' table using the execute method and fetches all results using the fetchall method. It then displays the details of all books to the user.
If the choice is '6', it selects all rows from the 'members' table and displays the details of all members to the user.
If the choice is '7', it prompts the user for the book ID to delete a book. It checks if the book exists and if it is available (not borrowed). If so, it deletes the book from the 'books' table.
If the choice is '8', it prompts the user for the member ID to delete a member. It checks if the member exists and if there are no borrowed books associated with the member. If so, it deletes the member from the 'members' table.
If the choice is 'q', it breaks the loop and exits the system.
If the choice is invalid, it displays an error message.
After the loop exits, it closes the cursor using self.cursor.close() and closes the connection to the database using self.conn.close().
The code block at the end creates an instance of the LibrarySystem class, library_system, and calls its run_library_system method to start the library management system.

Overall, the code provides a command-line interface for managing a library. Users can perform various operations such as checking out and returning books, adding and deleting members, and viewing the library's books and members. The data is stored in an SQLite database named 'library.db'.
